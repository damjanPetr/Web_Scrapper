# Web Scrapper

## Description

## WHY
    
 RSS is slowly phasing out as a way to track stuff , but I need a surefire way to have my latest articles from the blogs/places I frequent without any of the usual clutter that comes with modern "Note Taking" measures,or having to deal with pointless accounts. 

  Thats why instead of wasting time to check the same page again and again, I've decided to make a simple web scrapper with the help of the tried and true Puppeteer library.

## Quick Usage
- Run The Development Server.
- Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.
